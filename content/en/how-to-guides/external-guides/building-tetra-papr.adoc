== Quick Synopsis

This guide will walk you through how to build a PAPR.  It assumes that you have some knowledge of soldering, 3D-printing, and cutting foam with a knife using a stencil, or that you're willing to learn, as the steps are fairly bsaic.  In the end, you will have three things: a box with a filter and a fan in it, a second box with batteries and a fan controller, and a mask.  These three things will be connected by hoses, wires, and straps, and you'll have something that will protect both you from breathing in aerosolized virii and prevent you from spreading virii to those around you.  

Please note that this system will not protect you from anything landing in your eyes.  For that protection, either the mask will need to be modified to be a helmet, or you will need a face shield.

== Introduction

Now, in the time of COVID-19, many people are at risk for exposure to the virus and cannot afford to get infected.  These people can isolate themselves, but often, their professions or requirements for daily life will take them in contact with other people, and they need some form of protection.  Masks definitely help, but can become uncomfortable to wear, and also obscure the face of the wearer.  This guide will walk you through creating a Powered Air-Purifying Respirator, which will protect the wearer and those around them from airborne viruses and bacteria, while at the same time providing positive airflow to the wearer's face.  That airflow makes sure that the wearer has a supply of fresh, cooled, clean air that has gone through a filtration process, and, in our tests, is the equivalent of wearing an N99 mask.

The core of the idea is fairly simple: put a fan behind a filter in an airtight box, have the fan pull air through the filter, and push that air through a hose.  The hose goes to a mask on the wearer's face.  The wearer then breathes out, and air travels through a second hose back into the box and back out through the same filter.  This system means that the wearer only needs one filter for both inhalation and exhalation.  The wearer is protected from their surroundings, and anyone in the surroundings is protected from the wearer, both by the same filter.  The filter itself lasts for 3 months or so, while the battery is rechargeable for repeated use.

== 3D Printed Parts

== Building the Battery/Controller Box

We start by building the battery controller box.  You will need these components on hand:

1.  Battery Case ("M12 Controller Body")
2.  Battery lid ("M12 Lid")
3.  Crimper
4.  Needle-nose pliers
5.  Soldering iron/solder/soldering tools
6.  2 red jacketed stranded wire ~2-3 inches (7-10 cm) long
7.  2 black jacketed stranded wire ~2-3 inches (7-10 cm) long
8.  Heat Shrink (to protect wire connections)
9.  2 Male Spade Quick Splice Crimp Terminals
10.  Flush Cutters
11.  Wire stripper
12.  Deburring tool
13.  Philips head screwdriver

## Build Steps

### Prepare the wires

#### Cut the wires to size.

To do so, you will need to cut them down to their lengths (our build used ~3 inch/10 cm lengths).  We prepared all six wires (4 stranded and 2 solid) to be basically the same dimensions: ~3 inches/~10 in length, 0.5 cm insulation stripped from both ends.

#### Tin the stranded wires.  

Follow this guide here: 
https://www.thespruce.com/tinning-stranded-electrical-wires-1152893

### M12 controller circuitry 

#### Snip a portion of the spade connector
A video describing this step:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-bJ9DFfB/0/1920/i-bJ9DFfB-1920.mp4[]

#### Clean the M12 battery holder spade ports
On the inside of the printed M12 box, there are two slots where the spade connector should fit in.  These slots may have some extra plastic around them due to print quality issues, so use an x-acto knife to clean those slots:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-V6kxqFR/0/1920/i-V6kxqFR-1920.mp4[]

#### Insert the spade connectors into the M12 box
These spade connectors should be inserted with red on the left, black on the right.  The snipped connector should slide in place and prevent the spade connector from coming back out again.

#### Install the board into the M12 box

This video captures the entire process:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-fHTTM3s/0/1920/i-fHTTM3s-1920.mp4[]

Essentially, these steps are followed:

1.  Remove the knob and nut from the control board
2.  Install the power plug into the box
3.  Connect the knob and spade power wires to the board (red to plus, black to minus, spades to DC in and power plug to motor control)
4.  Place the board in the box
5.  Screw the nut and motor control knob onto the board from the outside of the box
6.  Check the connection by turning on the power knob and looking for the red LED on the board to light up
7.  Close access to the circuitboard using the M12 Lid

You may need to deburr the edges of the hole:

Congratulations, you have completed the assembly of the power box for your PAPR!


== Building the Fan Box

You will need these parts for this step:

1.  Fan box 
2.  Filter box
3.  Completed power plug with solid wires
4.  Dryer tape
5.  Funnel
6.  Weather stripping
7.  2mm foam
8.  Filter Box Stencil
9.  Box Gasket Stencil
10.  An x-acto knife
11.  The deburring tool
12.  Hex screw driver
13.  HEPA Type-A Filter
14.  Hex screws
15.  Hex nuts


The fan box is assembled in such a way that different regions of the HEPA filter are used for the inspiratory and expiratory air pathways, and uses foam, dryer tape, and weather sealing to ensure the separation between chambers.

### Install the fan, funnel, and power

#### Install the power socket

This socket will allow the guitar cable to connect the fan box to the power box so that the knob on the power box can control the fan.  Inserting the socket is fairly straightforward, and is explained in this video:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-ZP5x4Hh/0/1920/i-ZP5x4Hh-1920.mp4[]

#### Connect the fan to the power cable. 

Insert the red wire into the side fan connector where the red cable enters the connector, and the black wire into the black side of the fan connector.  You can test by plugging the guitar cable into the power socket and into the fan socket; turning the knob should power the fan.

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-wSJHwgM/0/X2/i-wSJHwgM-X2.jpg[]


#### Install the funnel and fan in the box

Place the dryer tape around the junction between the fan and the funnel, and then slide the complex into the hole into the fan box.  Once the complex is snapped in place, wrap the rest of the tape around the junction between the fan and the funnel.

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-ZWcDgSs/0/1920/i-ZWcDgSs-1920.mp4[]

#### Test that the fan blows

Connect the guitar cable between the M12 power box and the fan box.  The knob should control the fan and allow for variable blower settings, and air should not be coming out of any part of the system except one side of the funnel.

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-tGbPSJR/0/1920/i-tGbPSJR-1920.mp4[]


### Install the foam and weather stripping

This video explains the process and explain the reasoning behind the different types of sealing:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-St3Htsb/0/1920/i-St3Htsb-1920.mp4[]

#### Use the stencils to cut foam inserts

There are three foam inserts, and two have stencils in this build that are 3d printable.  Cutting the foam follows the procedure outlined in this video:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-8pkKGjH/0/1920/i-8pkKGjH-1920.mp4[]

#### After the foam is cut, punch holes for the screws in the Box Gasket foam

The purpose of this step is to allow screws to connect the fan holder box to the filter holder box and not twist the foam insert.

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-M7jLBqH/0/X2/i-M7jLBqH-X2.jpg[]

#### Place foam cut to match the foam gasket inside the filter box

As per this photo, finger fitting is fine:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-f452mKq/0/X2/i-f452mKq-X2.jpg[]

#### Place the nuts and spacers inside the filter box

As per this photo.  Drop the nut in first, and then the spacer.  A mallet may be required to facilitate insertion of the spacers, depending on print quality.  A hammer may damage the PLA.

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-rMsPCGd/0/X2/i-rMsPCGd-X2.jpg[]

#### Place the foam cut to match the box gasket insert around the outer lower edge of the filter box

As per this photo:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-96G4GCn/0/X2/i-96G4GCn-X2.jpg[]

#### Connect the two boxes

Take the foam insert portion remaining from cutting the Box Gasket foam, and place that between the two boxes.  You will need to cut out the foam to match the image below:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-x2ZwDdw/0/X2/i-x2ZwDdw-X2.jpg[]


Place hex nuts in the outer screw wells and screw the boxes together.

#### Place the weather stripping on the rails of the filter box

Following this photo:
https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-fQ7gKh2/0/X2/i-fQ7gKh2-X2.jpg
 

### Install the filter and the top grill

The filter should fit directly into the top, but will be a tight squeeze.  Place your filter with these lines down towards the fan:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-ZLxMzcg/0/X2/i-ZLxMzcg-X2.jpg[]


== Attaching to the Mask

Attaching to the mask is a matter of first deciding where the box will be worn (on the chest, as a backpack, or some other orientation).  We recommend cutting the webbing such that the box can be worn comfortably with the m12 controller box threaded through the webbing.  You may need someone to help you with this:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-8rj2S5Z/0/X2/i-8rj2S5Z-X2.jpg[]

The hoses can be fit by tension by pushing into the mask and into the funnel boxes.

And now your PAPR is done!

Mix and match colors by doing various prints:

image::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-xgj7v3S/0/X2/i-xgj7v3S-X2.jpg[]

The printed box has 8 locations that are intended to thread 1-inch webbing, and the M12 controller box also has a slot for the same webbing, so that the controller can be worn on the webbing.  If you use the recommended webbing, cut the lengths that you need for how you want to wear the box, being careful to use a lighter or some other open flame to melt the ends of the webbing to prevent fraying in the future.  The arrangement of webbing is much more of a personal style choice, and there are plenty of configurations that someone can choose.  

The mask can be held in place with elastic, a shoestring, or another form of cloth or plastic that will fit through the printed holes.  We use the listed bathing suit elastic. 


== Care and Maintenance

This PAPR has been found to easily exceed n95 filtration both for the wearer and for those around them (in the sense that the wearer's exhaled air is filtered).  These types of devices can last for a long time, but some care and maintenance must be performed.


1.  The filter should last for around 3 months with relatively constant use.  The system will just blow less air as the filter becomes more clogged, so replace the filter if your PAPR is not pushing enough air for you.
2.  The battery will need to be charged after several hours of use.  If you're using the PAPR for more than a few hours at a time, you may want a second battery.
3.  Water will condense in the exhalation hose during the normal course of use.  We recommend regularly cleaning out the hoses; there are several CPAP hose cleaning kits, or a bottle brush could work as well, with one candidate in the tool list above.
